## Description 

This a backend API for a social-networking web application which allows joined users to share thoughts with friends and react to their friends' thoughts. It employes Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and Mongoose ODM. The purpose of choosing a NoSQL database is to allow the website to handle large amounts of unstructured data efficiently.

A walkthrough video demonstrating functional CRUD routes for users, thoughts, and reactions may be viewed at [this link.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13uyeDKbyI-OSAThIX2GaZcbbOYfvIwFW/view)

The application's GitHub repository may be accessed at [this link.](https://github.com/mankovich/social-network-API)

## Installation 

Because the application is simply the backend database routing for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting user data, the installation process would involve installing the necessary node modules before running the server and initializing the database. 

## Usage 

For the same reason, there's little to instruct usage-wise in using this standalone backend set-up.
